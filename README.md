# ubiquitousse

Set of various libraries I use for game development, mainly with LÃ–VE. Most of which has already been done before, but these are tailored to what I need. They can be used independently too (you should be able to only pick the directories of the libraries you need; some modules depends on each other though, see documentation for details).

This provides, sorting the one with the fewest existing alterative as far as I know first:

* `ldtk` provides a [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) level importer
* `gltf` provides a [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) model loader
* `ecs` provides [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) facilities
* `input` provides input management facilities
* `timer` provides time management facilities
* `signal` provides a simple signal / observer pattern implementation
* `asset` provides barebones asset loading facilities
* `scene` provides some scene management facilities
* `util` provides some random, occasionally useful functions

You can find the documentation [here](https://reuh.github.io/ubiquitousse/index.html) or in the `docs/` directory.

Documentation is done in LDoc-like comments in source files, but LDoc doesn't really like how I structure my libraries (and the fact I use [Candran](https://github.com/Reuh/candran)) so you will need my [LDoc fork](https://github.com/Reuh/LDoc) if you want to generate the documentation yourself.

Whatever is currently on the master branch should be working and usable. Changelog, including breaking changes, are documented in commit messages.
