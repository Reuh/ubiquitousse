# ubiquitousse

Set of various libraries I use for game development, mainly with LÃ–VE. Nothing that hasn't been done before, but these are tailored to what I need.

Documentation is done in LDoc-like comments in source files, but LDoc doesn't really like how I structure my libraries so you can't really generate documentation with it.

Whatever is currently on the master branch should be working and usable. Changelog, including breaking changes, are documented in commit messages.
