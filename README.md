# ubiquitousse

Set of various libraries I use for game development, mainly with LÃ–VE. Nothing that hasn't been done before, but these are tailored to what I need. They can be used independently too.

You can find the documentation [here](https://reuh.github.io/ubiquitousse/index.html) or in the `docs/` directory.

Documentation is done in LDoc-like comments in source files, but LDoc doesn't really like how I structure my libraries (and the fact I use [Candran](https://github.com/Reuh/candran)) so you will need my [LDoc fork](https://github.com/Reuh/LDoc) if you want to generate the documentation yourself.

Whatever is currently on the master branch should be working and usable. Changelog, including breaking changes, are documented in commit messages.
